  To connect workspaces, modules, and policy sets to git repositories containing Terraform configurations, Terraform Cloud needs access to your version control system (VCS) provider.
  Use this page to configure OAuth authentication with your VCS provider.
  For more information, please see the Terraform Cloud documentation on Configuring Version Control Access (https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/vcs/index.html)
  The oauth-token object represents a VCS configuration which includes the OAuth connection and the associated OAuth token. This object is used when creating a workspace to identify which VCS connection to use.
